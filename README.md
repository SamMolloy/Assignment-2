Second OOP Assignment of a game

Instructions:

On the main menu you are prompted to use the up arrow key to start the game. 
Once the game has started the arrow keys are used to move the player model around the screen.

Game Mechanics:

The goal of the game is to collect the green objects that are moving around the screen while also avoiding the red 
and orange objects. You start off with 5 lives and every time you hit a red or orange enemy object you lose 1 life.
Once your lives reach 0 a Game Over splash screen is displayed. Every 8 seconds the enemies speed up a little. Every
time you collect a green object a new enemy object is added to the game with a max of 15 enemies at at time.

Key Features:

This program incorporates inheritance and polymorphism.
The inheritance is used between the Collect and Enemy classes and the Enemy and Enemy2 classes. The polymorphism is 
used with the second Enemy as it extends the first enemy and then both types are stored in the same Arraylist.
